## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **AI-Driven Health Insights**

To ensure accessibility across India’s diverse linguistic landscape, HealthBridge offers **multilingual support**, enabling users to interact with the platform in their native languages, reducing barriers related to language and literacy.

### 4. **Futuristic UI/UX**
